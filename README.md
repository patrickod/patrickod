Originally from Dublin, Ireland I live in San Francisco, California with my partner [Ariane](https://twitter.com/stembiosis) and our wonderful rescue dog Sophie. I'm a software security engineer with over a decade of experience building, growing, operating, and securing software businesses. Away from the keyboard I'm an avid photographer, musician, electronics tinkerer, and maker of various types. You can read more about my work on [my blog](https://www.patrickod.com).
